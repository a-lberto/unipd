# Aerodynamics
This folder contains the four main projects I worked on while preparing for my Aerodynamics exam.

## Irrotational field solutions

In these scripts you will find formulas to draw analytically the potential and current function level curves for the solutions of the following velocity fields:
- Undisturbed
- Single source
- Rankine solution (Velocity field and source)
- Source and sink
- Doublet
- Irrotational vortex
with a random point in the field and its curves.

For the potential around a cylinder, which can be constructed with a parallel field, a doublet pointing in the opposite direction and a vortex centered on the doublet, the curves were computed numerically.
